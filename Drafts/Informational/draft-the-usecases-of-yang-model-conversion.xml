            <t>This document contains the brief description and the guidelines for the
                usage of Yang model conversion (YMC). It demonstrates the benefits of
                YMC for both communication vendors and network operators, provides
                several use cases to show the proper operations, and provides the recommendations
                for the development.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>The Yang standards with version 1.0 <xref target="RFC6020">RFC 6020</xref>
                and version 1.1 <xref target="RFC7950">RFC 7950</xref> define a domain-
                specific language for network data modeling. By using Yang models, several network
                management protocols like <xref target="RFC6241">NETCONF</xref> and
                <xref target="RFC8040">RESTCONF</xref> are proposed. These protocols are deployed
                widely in network management systems (including network controllers). The
                Yang-model-driven systems generally generate codes from yang models by using Yang
                compiler, and executes network operations on these model data. A lot of Yang models
                are defined for the networks in different layers. The combination of multiple Yang
                models form a complete network model under specific scenario.
            </t>
            <t>
                A Yang model is composed of different statements. According to the descriptions in
                Yang standards, these statements could be divided into module statement, submodule
                statement, typedef statement, container statement, leaf-list statement, list statement,
                choice statement, etc. In order to manage the updates for Yang models in the
                equipment development, Yang standard introduces revision statement and augment
                statement to indicate the version and extension for a Yang model. However, these
                statements could only handle the model management in an incremental updating way, but
                couldn't handle the mapping problem between two similar Yang models. And with the
                widespread adoption of Yang, such a mapping problem occurs.
            </t>
            <t>
                Until now, many Yang models have been defined by different organizations, vendors, network
                operators, and foundations. These existed Yang models are deployed in different scenarios.
                However, these models don't coordinate with each other very well. For a certain part,
                the authors usually define duplicated and conflicted models to make this part meet their
                own requirements. And once the data conversion from one model to another is required,
                there is no such a solution defined. In order to address this problem, Yang model conversion
                is introduced. In reality, such a model conversion happens when:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>
                        A vendor is required to provide different models for different customers (telecom
                        operators, cloud computing companies, etc.) on the same equipment.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        A network operator needs to map all network models defined by all network equipment
                        into its own complete network model.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        An organization needs to map its own models into the models defined by another
                        organization.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                The conversion between two Yang models enables the concrete definition of model difference. In all
                conversion use cases, such a definition enhances the conversion robustness. Besides, it also make all
                gap between models evaluable.

        <section title="The usage limitation of Yang model conversion">
            <t>
                The model conversion MAY introduce information loss or information deviation while mapping the data
                from one model to another. Therefore, the conversion could not be applied when the gap between two
                models are non-negligible. Usually, only the mapping between two models that define the same
                equipment component MAY succeeds. Yang model conversion is not recommended if the mapping problem
                could be solved by simple augmentation, or other solutions without information loss or information deviation.
            </t>
            <t>
                In database, there MAY be only one model stored, and other model data are generated by Yang model
                conversion timely. Some nodes defined in schema tree MAY be skipped after model conversion. If the rpc
                service or notification service include these skipped nodes, these services are not available.

        <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

        <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
         1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
         2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
            (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

         Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
         If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
         directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
         with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
         filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

        <!-- Change Log

    v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

    v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                          v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
    v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                          other minor corrections
    v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                          Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                          figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                          Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
    v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                          added discussion of rfc include.
    v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative
                          images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).  -->
